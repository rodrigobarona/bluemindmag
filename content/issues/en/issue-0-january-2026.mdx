## Editor's Note

**By Pedro Seixas, PT, PhD**

Surfing has always been more than a sport. It is a connection to nature, a form of therapy, and a lifestyle that shapes who we are. Welcome to Blue Mind Magazine.

For years, I have witnessed the transformative power of the ocean—both as a physiotherapist working with athletes and as a surfer myself. This magazine is born from a simple belief: that science and surfing are not separate worlds, but intertwined paths leading to the same destination—human wellbeing.

In these pages, you will find the intersection of rigorous research and raw passion. We bring together scientists who study wave dynamics, psychologists who explore the mental health benefits of ocean immersion, and surfers who live these truths every day.
