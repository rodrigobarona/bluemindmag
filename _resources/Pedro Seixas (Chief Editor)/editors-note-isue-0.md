# EDITOR’S NOTE

Surfing has always been more than a sport.

It is a relationship — with the ocean, with our bodies, and with our minds. Every session is an experiment: balance, timing, fear, adaptation, joy. Yet, for decades, much of what happens between a surfer and a wave has remained unexplored, unexplained, or locked away in academic language.

BLUE MIND was created to change that.

This magazine exists at the intersection where surf culture meets science. Not to complicate surfing — but to understand it better. To translate research into real-world knowledge that helps surfers stay healthier, perform better, and connect more deeply with the ocean.
Afterall, science is already shaping the future of surfing: from injury prevention and performance training, to wave engineering, surf pools, big wave, water safety and environmental protection.

Our goal is to make that knowledge accessible, practical, and relevant - for everyday surfers, coaches, lifeguards, shapers, and ocean professionals.

´This “issue zero” is a starting point.
Inside, you’ll meet scientists who surf, surfers who study science, and professionals working quietly behind the scenes to push our sport forward. You’ll find research explained without jargon, real stories from the water, and ideas that might change the way you look at your next session.

BLUE MIND is from surfers, to surfers.
Curious. Open-minded. Grounded in evidence, but driven by passion.

Welcome to the lineup. See you in the water.
