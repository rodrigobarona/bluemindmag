Perfect — thank you for the context and for sharing **Issue 0**.
This helps _a lot_. What you’ve created already has a **very clear editorial identity**, and now the website must **respect it and elevate it**, not fight it.

Below is a **refined, very specific design + build prompt** tailored **exactly to Blue Mind Magazine**, written so a **junior developer** understands _what to build_ **and why**.

You can treat this as:

- a **project brief**
- a **README**
- or a **design contract between editorial and development**

# 🌊 BLUE MIND — Premium Surf Magazine Website

**Design & Development Brief for Junior Developer**

---

## 0️⃣ What You Are Building (Read This First)

You are building the **digital home of Blue Mind Magazine**.

This is:

- a **surf science magazine**
- a **quarterly editorial project**
- **from surfers, to surfers**
- calm, intelligent, evidence-based, human

This is **not**:

- a surf shop
- a news site
- a blog
- a loud surf brand

If the website feels _quiet, confident, and thoughtful_, you’re on the right track.

---

## 1️⃣ Brand Understanding (Non-Negotiable)

### Brand Essence

**Blue Mind** lives at the intersection of:

- Surf culture
- Science & evidence
- Health, performance, and longevity
- Community and respect for the ocean

Tone:

> Calm. Grounded. Intelligent. Human.

The website should feel like:

> _A printed science-surf journal you’d read slowly after a session._

---

### Core Brand Data (Use Exactly This)

**Name:** Blue Mind
**Tagline:** From surfers, to surfers
**Positioning:** Surf Science — Where surf & science meet

**Colors**

- Black: `#000000`
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Dark Turquoise: `#0097B2` (use sparingly, as accent only)

**Typography**

- Headlines: **League Gothic** or **Oswald**
- Body text: **Open Sans**
- Accents / small labels: **Telegraf**

No extra fonts. No experiments.

---

## 2️⃣ Content Logic (Inspired by the Magazine)

Your Issue 0 already defines the **content structure**.
The website must mirror it.

### Editorial Sections Logic

Use the magazine’s logic as navigation anchors:

- Warm-Up
- Main Heat
- Cool-Down

Content types:

- Meet the Scientist
- Meet the Surfer
- Student’s Peak
- First Set / Second Set (research-based features)
- Tips & Tricks
- Community
- Surfing Medicine International

**Important:**
These are _editorial concepts_, not categories with icons or cards.

---

## 3️⃣ Website Architecture

### Pages to Build (No More, No Less)

1. **Home**
2. **Issues**
3. **Issue Detail**
4. **Read (Flipbook)**
5. **About Blue Mind**
6. **Contact**

Simple. Editorial. Calm.

---

## 4️⃣ Homepage — Exact Intent

The homepage is **not a feed**.
It is a **cover + editorial introduction**.

### Structure

#### 1. Hero Section

- Full-width image from the current issue
- Overlay text (very minimal):

  - BLUE MIND
  - SURF SCIENCE
  - ISSUE 0 — JANUARY 2026

- CTA: **Read Issue 0**

No buttons yelling. No animations screaming.

---

#### 2. Editor’s Statement (Short)

Pull from the Issue 0 editorial tone:

> “Surfing has always been more than a sport…”

This sets **intellectual credibility**.

---

#### 3. Current Issue Highlight

- Cover image
- Issue metadata
- Short description
- Button: **Open Magazine**

---

#### 4. Featured Sections

Choose **3 editorial highlights**:

- Meet the Scientist
- Student’s Peak
- Surfing Medicine International

Each:

- Large image
- Title
- One-line description
- Click → Issue Detail (not article pages yet)

---

#### 5. Past Issues (Future-proof)

- Grid of covers
- Calm spacing
- No hover gimmicks

---

## 5️⃣ Issue Detail Page

This page introduces the issue **before reading it**.

### Layout

1. Issue cover (large)
2. Editorial description
3. Table of contents (in magazine order)
4. Credits
5. CTA: **Read the Full Magazine**

This page must feel like **opening the magazine slowly**, not clicking content.

---

## 6️⃣ Flipbook Reader Page

This is sacred space.

Rules:

- No header
- No footer
- Neutral background
- Centered flipbook
- Fullscreen enabled
- Mobile usable (but calm)

The flipbook must feel like:

> _A digital version of your printed Issue 0 — nothing more._

---

## 7️⃣ Visual Rules (Extremely Important)

### Layout

- Max width: 1100–1200px
- Large vertical rhythm
- No cards
- No boxes
- No shadows
- No rounded corners

### Imagery

- Let photos breathe
- Full-width where possible
- No heavy overlays
- Respect photographer credits

### Color Use

- Black & white dominate
- Turquoise only for:

  - links
  - separators
  - subtle emphasis

Never turn the site turquoise-heavy.

---

## 8️⃣ Motion & Interaction

Motion should feel like **ocean swell**, not TikTok.

Allowed:

- Slow fade-ins
- Gentle scroll reveals
- Subtle hover opacity

Forbidden:

- Bounce
- Scale explosions
- Parallax overload

---

## 9️⃣ Mobile Philosophy

Mobile is **editorial-first**, not stripped down.

- Large images still matter
- Text remains readable
- Flipbook works
- No clutter

Think: _reading on the beach at sunset_.

---

## 🔟 Developer Mindset (Most Important Section)

Before implementing anything, ask:

> “Would this feel right in the printed magazine?”

If not:

- Remove it
- Simplify it
- Slow it down

This project values:

- restraint over features
- clarity over cleverness
- respect over noise

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Definition of “Done”

The website is successful when:

- It feels premium with little content
- It feels calm even when scrolling
- It respects science and surf equally
- It feels closer to a journal than a website

If it feels _slower_ than the internet — you’re doing it right.

---

If you want next, I can:

- Translate this into **Figma wireframes**
- Turn it into **developer tickets**
- Create a **homepage layout sketch**
- Write a **design system file**
- Or create a **prompt for Webflow / Next.js implementation**

Just tell me the next step 🌊
