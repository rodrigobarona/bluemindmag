# Surfing Medicine International

## Meet the SMI - Surfing Medicine International!

This extraordinary organisation, was founded by 3 friends: Ingvar, Dion (NL) and Ogi (Austria). All of them medical doctors and stoked surfers. In 2012, Arvid Schigt (NL) and David Hefer (Germany) joined them to put up the first World Surfing Conference held at Sagres, Portugal, which counted with more than 85 participants from 19 countries worldwide. And then, it never stopped!

After 12 editions of Advanced Surf Life Support Courses, 8 World Conferences held in Europe and Australia, and other all-year around initiatives, SMI as set its mark as a respectful and key player organisation regarding surfing health and drowning prevention.

### Dr.INGVAR BERG

Ingvar grew up in The Hague, in the Netherlands, far from tropical reefs, but close to wind and speed. At 12, he was already skateboarding and snowboarding.
Windsurfing followed and the ocean entered his life head-on in 2007, during a

trip to Australia, where he bought his first surfboard in Noosa and spent weeks surfing around Byron Bay and nearby breaks.

A medical doctor since 2009 and an Emergency Medicine specialist since 2017, Ingvar sees the ocean and emergency care as parallel worlds where calm under pressure saves lives.

At 41, he is CEO of Surfing Medicine International (SMI), a non-profit organization dedicated to the science of surfing medicine. He leads an international team of volunteers — doctors, researchers, and surf professionals — united by science, passion, and respect for the ocean.

SMI develops research, injury prevention programs, and educational platforms such as Online Surf Life Support, which teaches surfers board rescues and CPR.

The mission is clear: make surfing safer and recognize surfers as key bystander rescuers in drowning situations.

At SMI, science is not an add-on - it is the foundation. All programs are built on scientific evidence, guidelines, and best practices. Trusting science means embracing constant evolution, review, and learning.

The vision for the next decade is both ambitious and practical: surf lifesaving and CPR courses for surfers as a global norm, injury prevention programs, surfers informed about health risks from day one — and empowered as ambassadors for health, safety, and the ocean.

In and out of the water, Ingvar continues to do the same thing: breathe deeply, stay focused, and respect the power of the wave.

" SMI relies on surf enthusiastic health professionals, scientists and other volunteers, sharing knowledge and experiences to inform and educate coastal communities to “Keep the surfer healthy and safe”
